    "The Stern-Gerlach[SG] experiment is one of the key events in the history of Quantum Mechanics as it provides evidence for the quantum nature of the spin angular momentum. Modern Research has paved the way for experimental realisations of physical systems which are analogous to the SG experiment. One such analogy is the All Optical Stern Gerlach experiment. These analogies apart from being aesthetically pleasing, contribute to the understanding of such systems and also lead to new exciting applications. In this paper, we will relate everything that is present in the original SG experiment with its optical counterpart. \n",

    "For e.g, we will show that the Coupled Wave Equations[CWEs], if manipulated correctly transform into the Transverse Pauli Equation which describes the motion of the particle in the Stern Gerlach Experiment. The non-linear coupling and the phase mismatch parameter constitute an effective magnetic field. Consequently, it will be shown that the gradient in the non-linear coupling will deflect the mutual beam into two different directions.\n",

In the figure below, both vectors stay tangential to the curved surface at all times. They start from the \"north pole\" , and get transported along the path, remaining as parallel as possible to the direction they were pointing at before each infinitesimal displacement (the long vector points \"South\" and the short one points \"East\" all the time). After completing the closed path, or loop, the vectors go back to the original point, but they find themselves rotated with respect to the directions they were pointing at when the journey started. Note that the vectors \"rotate\" despite the fact we have been careful to keep them parallel during transport.In our example, where the loop surrounds one eighth of the sphere, the rotation angle amounts to $90^0$. A larger path surrounding for example one quarter of the sphere, would rotate the parallel-transported vectors by $180^0$. An even larger loop, a diameter, surrounding (on both sides) half the sphere gives a rotation angle of $360^0$, i.e. no rotation at all."

This geometric phase was shown to be calculated via the so called Pancharatnam connection, demonstrating an intrinsic dependence on the geometric properties of the path taken in polarization space. A special case is when the polarization state undergoes a closed trajectory over several points and returns to its original value.

However, each individual photon usually has a well-defined frequency and energy. Interestingly, the superposition principle of quantum physics allows for yet another version of polychromatic light: a single photon in a superposition of two discrete frequencies $ν_A$ and $ν_B$. In this case, neither the frequency nor the energy of the photon is well defined. In some sense, such a “bichromatic” photon can be thought of as having two different colors at the same time, only one of which would be revealed if the photon were measured by a spectrometer or detected by eye.<br>\n",
    "However, the creation and manipulation of \"bichromatic photons\" is quite challenging. The difficulty is that such processes require an interaction between photons of different frequencies, and in most media, light beams do not interact. We know that the situation changes if light propagates in a nonlinear medium, where the optical properties vary with the intensity of light. The nonlinear response results in an interaction between photons, providing a means with which to convert them to a different frequency. To make this process efficient, however, the medium must be pumped with separate high-power laser beams. Several experiments have succeeded in creating suitable single-photon nonlinearities of which the issue dealt in the paper could also be modified such that it falls under this catergory.<br>\n",
    "The input idler wave can be viewed as existing in a single photon state. On application of the optical Stern-Gerlach deflector the result will be a single-photon 2-qubit state in both frequency, i.e., either the signal or the idler frequencies, as well as in direction, in one of the two output angles.Thus ,a Stern-Gerlach deflector for single photons may, play an important role in the realization of quantum mechanical applications based on photonic qubits."
