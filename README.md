## PH 421 Photonics: Student Projects (2020)

### **Instructor:** Professor Anshuman Kumar, Physics Department, IIT Bombay

Project topics have been decided by the instructor keeping the match with our course content in mind. No changes are permitted in the project topics as of now.

Total strength is 62, so we will have 15 groups of 4 people each and 1 group of 2 people.

Requirements:

- A 1 hour long **pre-recorded** presentation by each team, which should be made available to the entire class on microsoft teams before your live presentation date
- A 15 minute shorter **live** presentation during the class:
  - Giving a broader picture of the work
  - Explaining the specific calculations/plots you reproduced
  - Live iPython notebook demo reproducing the plots
- In lieu of a traditional project report, an [executable paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-020-00403-4) (iPython notebook is strongly encouraged) reproducing the calculations/plots/derivations needs to be supplied to the instructor for evaluation
- In both the presentations as well as the executable paper, **details of the contributions of individual group members** to the project should be clearly spelt out.
- Evaluation is based on the following criteria:
  - Understanding of the topic: breadth and depth (eg. via reading cross-references)
  - Quality of presentation (eg. motivation, breaking down the problem, conclusion)
  - Reproducing parts of the paper (i.e. your executable paper (iPython notebook) demo) -- this component has the highest weightage

\* means that some prior exposure to quantum optics will help in the project
